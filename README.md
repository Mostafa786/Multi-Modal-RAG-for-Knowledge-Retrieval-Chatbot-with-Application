# 🚀 IoT RAG Assistant

A domain-focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed specifically for IoT, Hardware, and Backend workflows.
This project was built after noticing how general-purpose LLMs struggle with hardware-related questions such as ESP modules, sensors, microcontrollers, or backend integrations — so the goal here is to create an assistant that truly understands these domains.

# 🔍 What Is This Project?

This is an LLM-powered assistant that uses your own curated documents (notes, datasheets, hardware references, backend explanations…etc) and retrieves the most relevant context before generating an answer.

It acts like ChatGPT but specialized for IoT engineers.

## The system uses:

FastAPI for the backend

LangChain for vector search

A streaming LLM for token-by-token responses

RAG pipeline to ensure accurate, context-based answers

Vector database to store your IoT knowledge base

A UI (Flutter or Web) that behaves like a chat interface

# 🧠 Why I Built This

While working on IoT projects, I constantly ran into a limitation:
General AI models often give very generic answers when asked about:

Wiring sensors

ESP8266 / ESP32 issues

Microcontroller behavior

Merging IoT with backend APIs

Protocols (MQTT / HTTP / UART)

Real hardware troubleshooting

So I built this assistant to fix that.
Your own documents become its brain — and the answers become accurate, reliable, and domain-specific.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Backend	FastAPI
AI Engine	LangChain, LLM Streaming
RAG	Vector DB + Similarity Search
Storage	FAISS (or any vector DB)
Frontend	Flutter App (Chat-style UI)
Language	Python

# 📌 How It Works
1. User Sends a Question

The app sends a POST request containing the IoT question.

2. Relevant Documents Are Retrieved
vector_db.similarity_search(query_question, k=4, filter=metadatas[0])


The system finds the 4 most relevant documents based on semantic similarity.

3. Context + Question → LLM Prompt

The answer is generated strictly from retrieved context.

4. Streaming Response

Tokens are sent one-by-one in real-time using FastAPI’s StreamingResponse.


# 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mostafa786/IoT-Rag-Project.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

5. Start the Flutter UI (if used)
flutter run

# 🌐 API Endpoint
